# Implement Simple CRUD API

Your task is to implement simple CRUD API using a simple in-memory data structure.

# Details:
  Create a Flask application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of books. The application should have the following routes:

  1. **GET** _/books_: This route should return a list of all books.
  2. **GET** _/books/<id>_: This route should return the details of a specific book identified by its ID.
  3. **POST** _/books_: This route should allow users to add a new book to the list.
  4. **PUT** _/books/<id>_: This route should allow users to update the details of a specific book identified by its ID.
  5. **DELETE** _/books/<id>_: This route should allow users to delete a specific book identified by its ID.


  The book details should include attributes like title, author, and publication year.
